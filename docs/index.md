# Db2 pureScale Overview

The Db2 pureScale simulator allows a user to explore some of the concepts that are associated with a pureScale system. The user can define simple configurations and try selects and updates against members using a variety of connection and locking strategies. Member and clients can be turned off to show the effects of the outage on the configuration and the resulting recovery that pureScale will automate. 

While the simulator has been designed to show the concepts of running a Db2 pureScale system, it does not show all the possible system actions and communications between the clients, members, and cluster adapters. A production pureScale system will have many additional optimizations that will minimize much of the communication that you may see as part of the simulation. However, the high-level messaging is essentially the same, so you will get a sense of how the system works.
